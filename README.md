# Overview

HMPPS Creating Future Opportunities (CFO) utilise the Case Assessment and Tracking System (CATS) to support delivery of https://www.CreatingFutureOpportunities.gov.uk (CFO Evolution). The programme utilises external funding to perform rehabilitative services with offenders in custody and the community. Approx. 600 users from non-government organisations use CATS to record work performed with offenders creating an evidence base that supports performance management, payments to providers, ongoing research and audits from external bodies.

* ASP.NET Core

# Mechanism (How does it communicate with other systems? Frequency of data pull/push, reporting, events etc) 

Interactions with other systems are currently performed using a manual file transfer process between networks, however in the next 12 months it is planned that CATS will interact with ministryofjustice/cfo-dms2

# Building and Tool Restore

The project supports MSSQL.

## Cake scripts.

To publish the code and generate an indempotent sql update script.

```powershell
dotnet tool restore
dotnet cake build.cake 
```

## Database Migrations

### Add a migration

Running this will generate a new migration based on changes to the model

```powershell
dotnet cake migration.cake --name MigrationName
```
In Development the database migrations will be applied automatically.

Other environments should use the migrations.sql file that gets generated by the publish step


# Publishing (preview)

This repository uses [Aspire]("https://github.com/dotnet/aspire") for service composition (dependency injection, service discovery, and configuration management). 

Aspire is also used to provide a Kubernetes publishing workflow that is currently in preview: container image build & push, and generation/packaging of Kubernetes manifests & Helm charts.

Prerequisites
- Docker (for image builds)
- Access to a container registry (credentials configured)
- kubectl and a valid kubeconfig with cluster access
- Helm (for chart-based deployments)

### Build and publish image
```
IMAGE_NAME=hmpps-cfo/cats
TAG=latest
REGISTRY=registry.mycorp.com:1234

# Locally
dotnet publish src/Server.UI/Server.UI.csproj \
    --configuration Release \
    --os linux \
    --arch x64 \
    --target:PublishContainer \
    --property:ContainerRepository=$IMAGE_NAME \
    --property:ContainerImageTag=$TAG

# or to a remote registry (with the ContainerRegistry property)
dotnet publish src/Server.UI/Server.UI.csproj \
    --configuration Release \
    --os linux \
    --arch x64 \
    --target:PublishContainer \
    --property:ContainerRegistry=$REGISTRY \
    --property:ContainerRepository=$IMAGE_NAME \
    --property:ContainerImageTag=$TAG
```

### Generate Kubernetes manifests & Helm charts
```
dotnet aspire publish -o aspire-output
```

### Deploy (using Helm upgrade)
```
helm upgrade --install aspire ./aspire-output --namespace default \
    --set parameters.cats.cats_image=$IMAGE
```
